 *
 * 12. Integer to Roman
 * Medium
 *
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
 *
 * Symbol       Value
 * I             1
 * V             5
 * X             10
 * L             50
 * C             100
 * D             500
 * M             1000
 *
 * For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together.
 * 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II.
 * The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
 *
 * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
 * However, the numeral for four is not IIII.
 * Instead, the number four is written as IV.
 * Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
 * The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX.
 * There are six instances where subtraction is used:
 *
 *     I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
 *     X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
 *     C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 *
 * Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: num = 3
 * Output: "III"
 * Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: num = 58
 * Output: "LVIII"
 * Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: num = 1994
 * Output: "MCMXCIV"
 * Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *     1 <= num <= 3999
